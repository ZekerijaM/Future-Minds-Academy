                <h3>Overview</h3>
            </article>
            <p>
                The 2024 BMW M8 combines some baffling specs. It's as heavy as a <a
                    href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/f-150" target="_blank">Ford F-150</a>, it's quicker to 60
                mph
                than a
                Ferrari F8 Tributo, it rips through the quarter-mile in the same time as a Chevrolet Corvette Z06, and
                it
                does
                all of this with a back seat and an implacable luxury poise those others don't possess. Admittedly, the
                back
                seat isn't practical for full-grown humans. Even so, the M8's soothing cabin is one of the best places
                to
                experience what bodacious power delivery and all-wheel-drive traction can achieve together. Available as
                either
                a coupe or convertible (the four-door M8 Gran Coupe sedan is reviewed separately), the M8 represents the
                kind of
                comprehensively capable luxury GT we're more used to seeing with an Aston Martin or Bentley badge and a
                far
                heftier price.

                <h3>What's New for 2024?</h3>
            </article>
            <p>There are no changes for the 2024 model year, so the M8 carries over to the new year just as fabulous as
                it
                left
                2023.</p>

                <h3>Pricing and Which One to Buy</h3>
            </article>
            <p>Competition Coupe $140,795 <br> M8 Convertible $150,795 <br>We'd recommend the convertible; you won't
                lose
                any
                time at the track unless you hold a gold-level FIA racing license, and you can put the top down on the
                way
                to
                and from the circuit. Both body styles come standard with all manner of luxuries, so we'd select options
                that
                help unlock the M8's full performance potential. These include the M Carbon ceramic brakes, which BMW
                says
                reduce weight and are built to better withstand track abuse. We'd add the M Driver's package that
                marshals
                the
                car's formidable power at the limit and includes one day of performance driving school. Even better, the
                package
                increases the top speed from 155 to 189 mph. We'd also get the Driving Assistance Professional Package
                and
                the
                neck warmers for more comfortable driving at everyday speeds and in all types of weather.</p>

                <h3>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h3>
            </article>
            <p>The M8's long nose hides a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 617 horsepower and 553 pound-feet
                of
                torque. It sends that power through an excellent eight-speed automatic and on to a rear-biased
                all-wheel-drive
                system that can disengage power to the front axle. After time spent in both the coupe and convertible,
                our
                only
                disappointment about the powertrain is the limp exhaust note. When we strapped our test gear to the
                4251-pound
                M8 Competition coupe, we were blown away by its ridiculously quick acceleration, reaching 60 mph in just
                2.5
                seconds. Such explosive hustle deserves a hot-blooded song from the quad exhaust pipes. Small weaknesses
                emerge
                when pushing the M8, like minimal feedback through the thick steering wheel and a somewhat distant brake
                pedal
                feel. That said, those faults don't overshadow the enormous grip, compliant ride, and astonishing
                nimbleness
                of
                a two-door weighing more than two tons.</p>
