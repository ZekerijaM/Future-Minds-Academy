                <p>Few supercars actually get driven daily, but the 2023 Audi R8 seems designed for such a task. It
                    offers a reasonably easy-going ride along with its breakneck acceleration. The R8 shares its
                    underpinnings and its powertrain—a mighty V-10 and seven-speed automatic—with the wild Lamborghini
                    Huracán. The Audi is less hardcore than the Lambo, though, less intense on a twisty road or
                    racetrack. What the R8 offers instead is a level of refinement that’s more in line with the rest of
                    the Audi lineup. Its snug, two-seat cabin is lined with high-end materials and features a minimalist
                    design that forgoes the usual center-mounted infotainment display in favor of a digital gauge
                    display that serves both purposes. The interior is comfortable for both driver and passenger, and
                    the R8 would make a fine touring car if it weren’t for a puny cargo area that fits only one carry-on
                    suitcase. If this particular cross-section of performance and luxury appeals to you, now’s the time
                    to act, as this is the final year for Audi’s V-10–powered showpiece.</p>

                <p>This year marks the end of production for the current-generation R8. Audi is sending off the supercar
                    with a limited edition GT model, which is offered exclusively with rear-wheel drive and a 602-hp
                    version of the car’s V-10 engine. The GT also sports a revised seven-speed automatic transmission,
                    which Audi claims offers quicker shifts, and a drift-inducing Torque Rear driving mode to make
                    hooning the R8 easier. Then again, this doesn’t seem like a car that begs to be thrown around with
                    its rear tires smoking. Inside, the GT sports rich black- and-red upholstery, carbon-fiber interior
                    trim, and a numbered plaque noting its place in the production run. Other than the GT, the rest of
                    the lineup, which consists of a coupe and a convertible, remains unchanged.</p>
