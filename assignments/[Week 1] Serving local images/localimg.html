    <h2>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h2>
    <p> Audi endows the RS6 Avant with a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8, which generates 591 horsepower and 590
        pound-feet of torque. The powerplant combines with a 48-volt hybrid system that's found on other Audi products,
        such as the A8 luxury sedan and the Q8 crossover. The RS6 Avant feeds its standard Quattro all-wheel drive
        through an eight-speed automatic transmission. The combination helped rocket our 5031-pound test car to 60 mph
        in 3.1 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in 11.5 ticks at 120 mph. But those numbers don't accurately
        demonstrate the wagon's glorious ability to increase our heart rates and tingle our ear drums with its breakneck
        acceleration and badass soundtrack. Rolling on a set of 22-inch wheels with summer performance rubber and buoyed
        by a sport-tuned air suspension with adaptive dampers, our Tango Red RS6 Avant was able to deliver a relaxed or
        rollicking ride depending on the selected drive mode. The longroof Audi also felt extremely agile thanks to its
        four-wheel steering and torque-vectoring rear differential. Ours stopped from 70 mph in a tidy 160 feet with the
        standard brakes. A set of front and rear carbon-ceramic stoppers are available for a sizable sum, and the
        upgrade unlocks a higher top speed of 190 mph.</p>

    <h2>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h2>
    <p> Inside, the RS6 Avant showcases a sophisticated design and cutting-edge technology. The driver faces a 12.3-inch
        digital gauge cluster, and the dashboard features a pair of large touchscreens between the front passengers. The
        rest of the cabin is covered in leather and accentuated with racy materials. The RS6 Avant has a roster of
        upscale standard features, including heated and ventilated front seats, four-zone climate control, a panoramic
        sunroof, and wireless phone charging. Buyers can order a head-up display, massaging front seats, richer leather,
        and heated rear seats for more coin. The wagon has 30 cubic feet of cargo room behind the rear seats too. A
        power rear liftgate comes standard; a motion-activated one is optional.</p>
