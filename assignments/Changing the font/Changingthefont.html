            <h1>Overview</h1>

            <article>
                <p>The 2024 BMW M8 combines some baffling specs. It's as heavy as a Ford F-150, it's quicker to 60 mph
                    than
                    a
                    Ferrari F8 Tributo, it rips through the quarter-mile in the same time as a Chevrolet Corvette Z06,
                    and
                    it
                    does all of this with a back seat and an implacable luxury poise those others don't possess.
                    Admittedly,
                    the
                    back seat isn't practical for full-grown humans. Even so, the M8's soothing cabin is one of the best
                    places
                    to experience what bodacious power delivery and all-wheel-drive traction can achieve together.
                    Available
                    as
                    either a coupe or convertible (the four-door M8 Gran Coupe sedan is reviewed separately), the M8
                    represents
                    the kind of comprehensively capable luxury GT we're more used to seeing with an Aston Martin or
                    Bentley
                    badge and a far heftier price.</p>

            <h1>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h1>

            <article>
                <p>The M8's long nose hides a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 that makes 617 horsepower and 553
                    pound-feet
                    of
                    torque. It sends that power through an excellent eight-speed automatic and on to a rear-biased
                    all-wheel-drive
                    system that can disengage power to the front axle. After time spent in both the coupe and
                    convertible,
                    our only
                    disappointment about the powertrain is the limp exhaust note. When we strapped our test gear to the
                    4251-pound
                    M8 Competition coupe, we were blown away by its ridiculously quick acceleration, reaching 60 mph in
                    just
                    2.5
                    seconds. Such explosive hustle deserves a hot-blooded song from the quad exhaust pipes. Small
                    weaknesses
                    emerge
                    when pushing the M8, like minimal feedback through the thick steering wheel and a somewhat distant
                    brake
                    pedal
                    feel. That said, those faults don't overshadow the enormous grip, compliant ride, and astonishing
                    nimbleness of
                    a two-door weighing more than two tons.</p>
